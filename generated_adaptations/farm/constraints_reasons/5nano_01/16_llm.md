Strategy for further improvement

Goal reality:
- Keep the top-threat field always fully protected with exactly drones_for_full_protection drones.
- Minimize drone movement and churn, while still using drones efficiently to protect secondary fields when possible.
- Maintain a sensible floor of protection (at least half the drones protecting most of the time) and avoid over-protection.

Key improvement idea:
- Preserve stability by first honoring drones that are already protecting the top field. Only if there are fewer than the required cap drones protecting the top field do we bring in additional drones.
- Among the existing protectors, prioritize those that are closest to the top field to minimize arrival time. If more protectors exist than needed, select the closest ones.
- If there are no current protectors for the top field, fill the top field with the closest drones from the pool, ensuring the top field is reinforced as quickly as possible.
- After securing the top field, continue to allocate to secondary fields using the nearest available drones up to their capacities, and apply the “half protecting” rule to maintain coverage.
- Keep a small memory of previous assignments to bias future steps toward stability, but always guarantee the top field.
