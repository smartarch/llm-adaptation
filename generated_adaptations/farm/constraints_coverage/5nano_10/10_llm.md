Reasoning and adaptation strategy (updated)

Problem understanding
- Tests require that the most threatened field be fully protected whenever possible, using the closest drones to that field.
- Partial protection of multiple fields is discouraged; the strategy should prioritize fully protecting the top threat field, and only allocate drones to it as available.
- Drones not used to fully protect the top field should be idle to avoid wasting resources on underprotected fields.

Updated strategy
- Identify all fields with threat_level > 0 and select the most threatened field (highest threat).
- Determine how many drones are required for full protection of that field: required = drones_for_full_protection (default 1, clamp to non-negative).
- Compute which drones are currently protecting any field and, if necessary, reallocate drones to the top field:
  - Build a distance-based candidate list for all drones not currently protecting the top field, using distance to the field center.
  - Sort candidates by distance and pick the closest 'required' drones.
  - Reassign picked drones to protect the top field, removing them from any previous field protection if needed.
- Finally, assign groups: drones chosen for the top field get the group "protecting {top_field.id}", all others get "idle".
- If there are fewer drones than required, all drones are allocated to protect the top field (as many as possible); others remain idle.
